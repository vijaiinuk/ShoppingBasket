A small Shopping basket program to demonstrate decoupled class design and TDD.

The users of shopping basket can
1. add item/items
2. get item count
3. get basket total
4. clear basket
5. get unmodifiable items collections

All basket items inherit from abstraction Item/AbstractItem,
hence adding new type of item does not require modification to the Shopping basket.

Please checkout and run the tests to see the functionalities of the ShoppingBasket.
